transaction_detail final

I booked for the flat in Goldmine Kumar properties, Hadapsar, Pune on 12 June, 20.  I paid them Rs 63000/- Rs by Credit Card. They promised in case if I will cancel the flat I will get full refund within 45 days. Later I needed to cancel my booking and after a long wait I got the refund of Rs 61885/- only. When I asked why this is less, then he said rest of the amount was bank charges. This thing was never revealed to me at the time of booking and assured to get me 100% refund in any case. Now I am demaning the balance amout of Rs 1115/- and they are denying for it. 

Kindly help me to get my refund of Rs 1115/-



I did not get refund this product despite it was collected on 31 Aug

No. You cant. Here is my detailed answer on why.

That would be so annoying to a user and no browser will let you do that (even if you think its a valid use case for your scenario). Thats why browsers don't give control over how the install prompt event is triggered. Install prompt can be caught and shown once in the right time when you think user will be convinced to install it. If the user defers to install, you need to wait for a long time to catch the same event again to show the prompt again. How long is something depends on the browser and there is no standard time defined by any browser vendor.

Basically, if browser thinks user might like to add again based on the length and frequency of usage, then it will trigger the prompt event again. But that wont be in the same session/day for sure.

Hello there,
My name is Miral Maradia and I am engaged in IT industry from last 10 years. Basically I am a developer and holding a Tech Lead position in my current company. during my development experience mostly my primary language was PHP along with MySQL , JQeury, CSS and other relevant stuff. I also worked with different well known frameworks like Joomla, WordPress, Magento. So that was about my past experience but from the last year I planned to switch my key language to Python. Python is a very similar to PHP so it was not a challenge for me to switch. So far I worked in few small scale projects of Python and grab a good experience in it. Now I want to focus mainly on Python and looking for a better opportunity. Kindly consider my resume if I am a proper fit for you.
