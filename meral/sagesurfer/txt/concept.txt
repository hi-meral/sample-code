FLOAT V/S DOUBLE  (MYSQL)

They both represent floating point numbers. A FLOAT is for single-precision, while a DOUBLE is for double-precision numbers.

MySQL uses four bytes for single-precision values and eight bytes for double-precision values.

JOINS

INNER JOIN - fetches data if present in both the tables.

OUTER JOIN are of 3 types:

	LEFT OUTER JOIN - fetches data if present in the left table.
	RIGHT OUTER JOIN - fetches data if present in the right table.
	FULL OUTER JOIN - fetches data if present in either of the two tables.(NOT POSSIBLE IN MYSQL)

CROSS JOIN, as the name suggests, does [n X m] that joins everything to everything.
Similar to scenario where we simply lists the tables for joining (in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement), using commas to separate them.
