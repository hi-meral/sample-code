Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing  to inform you of my intention to resing from my position as PHP Developer as my contact is going over. My 2 years as Software Developer with Elan Technologies helped me to gain experience both in professionally and personally which will go along with me throughout my career. I am very thankful to company for providing me the opportunity to work with. 

My contract is going to over on 28th March, 2013. As I know my responsibility I can continue up to end of the month, which may enough time to handover my responsibility. My main thoughts now are to work as hard as possible to wrap up my current responsibilities and to hand over my responsibilities as smoothly as possible.

Please let me know relieving date so that I can make my future plan accordingly.

I wish the organization and everyone associated to it all the very best and thanks for the being supportive.
