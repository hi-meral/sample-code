Hello Sony,

I am user of Xperia J mobile phone. I purchased it on 13th Nov, 2012. After that I had complain of touch pad so that i submitted it for service during may 13 approx. Company took 10 days to repair. After that the problem was solved but a new problem has started in my mobile phone. Phone started restarting frequently, once or twice a day. Therefor I again submitted mobile in service center in august 13. This time it also took 8 days to repair but this time issue is not fixed. Still mobile is restarting. Now I am fade up with service. And also I am not able to manage without mobile for 8-10 days. Please provide me some solution for that.

Thanks,
Miral Maradia
