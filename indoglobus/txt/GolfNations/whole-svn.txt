One more thing I want to specify here that can we have put a full setup in SVN. ?  The reason behind it I checked out 3 plugins (Email Notifications, GHIN Integration and Online Join & Renew) which was given by Sheetal. However Sheetal's and my copy are different. Some of the pages are showing up in my local machine. So we are struggling for that. 

If you can provide the whole project in SVN, it would be more comfortable to work with. And less chances to conflict.

Please share your thought
