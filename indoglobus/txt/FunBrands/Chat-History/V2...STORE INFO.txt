group will be a new functionality
so add new table
*new
store_groups

miral [10:29 PM]
i see

Shikher [10:29 PM]
and table to link store and store groups
ilke store_group_map or something

miral [10:30 PM]
so dont I need to create simple store info page ?
at very first
?
or anything is exist ?

Shikher [10:31 PM]
yes you need to create store info page similar to customer details page
with all the sections that she has mentioned in the doc

miral [10:32 PM]
but store info will have only one store right
customer has a list

Shikher [10:33 PM]
yes but store has lot of info

miral [10:33 PM]
see page no 3

Shikher [10:33 PM]
like room names
feature config
start time
etc

miral [10:33 PM]
okay

Shikher [10:33 PM]
all will go in different collapsible sections
you can create multiple collapsible sections

miral [10:33 PM]
i see, on same page collapsible
right ?

Shikher [10:34 PM]
ya go through all the store info that she needs on that page
and then decide how many collapsible panel you need

miral [10:34 PM]
ya on page no 2

Shikher [10:35 PM]
store_groups can only be created by admin
actually that's should not be part of this task
don't worry about that
implement rest of it
I will tell it to Michael

miral [10:35 PM]
ok

Shikher [10:36 PM]
so implement everything except store group

miral [10:36 PM]
i see,
so it is clearing confusion

Shikher [10:36 PM]
after we create store group functionality, you will have to show store's group in summary section

miral [10:36 PM]
now ok

Shikher [10:36 PM]
and also
you will have to implement ability to update store's group from store details page
so probably you need to do part of it in store details page

miral [10:37 PM]
ok, so that section will be different from the given list

Shikher [10:38 PM]
ok
wait
I think you can do it like this -
show store's group in summary section
if store is not part of any group then you can print N/A
make "store's group" or 'N/A' clickable
on click you can open modal to show all available group with radio
with current group selected
since store can only be part of one group

miral [10:41 PM]
getting...

Shikher [10:41 PM]
also give add more group  button on modal
so make it clickable only for admins
so only admins can create/assign groups

miral [10:42 PM]
so that group will be added in dropdown

Shikher [10:42 PM]
dropdown?
radio list

miral [10:42 PM]
radio
yes

Shikher [10:43 PM]
so you do need to create store_groups table
but not store group maps
sine store will belong to only one group
just add fk in stores table
after store info page

miral [10:43 PM]
i see

Shikher [10:44 PM]
we can create separate icon for "Store Groups" for admins
so admins can view all groups
also if they want to add/edit

miral [10:44 PM]
Icon on home page right ?
for admin

Shikher [10:45 PM]
so basically admins can create/update groups either from store info page or "Store groups" page
but can assign only from store info page
don't worry about that page for now
just create store info page

miral [10:45 PM]
okay got it

Shikher [10:46 PM]
fk in stores will be null obviously since it's not required

miral [10:47 PM]
and this whole story on store info page will take place in another collapsible box like Payment Type, Feature config etc ?

Shikher [10:47 PM]
store group assignment?

miral [10:47 PM]
yes
title will be store group

Shikher [10:48 PM]
no just show store group name (N/A if not available) in summary section
and make that clickable for admins so that they can edit it
non admins will just see group if available
nothing if it's null in stores table
makes sense?
or may be just give small button on top right of summary section
to edit store group only for admins
whichever way you like

miral [10:50 PM]
see this picture

Shikher [10:50 PM]
probably button would look good

Your file was uploaded — it’s safe and sound in Slack. Unfortunately your workspace doesn’t have any storage space left. To get more space, you can upgrade to a paid account or delete some of your older files.

Untitled.png 

will it be like this ?
first is title , like all other title and when click it open the collapsible content

Shikher [10:51 PM]
I don't think we need separate section for group
since it will be just one word for store group and should be in summary so that it's always visible
and if it's null in stores table
we don't need to show that at all

miral [10:52 PM]
okay got it

Shikher [10:52 PM]
so small button on top of summary to edit group for admins should be sufficient

miral [10:52 PM]
so why we should not put in first box where name , address are displayed
I will add one more line if store group exist

Shikher [10:53 PM]
and then that button can open modal with group radios and ability to add more groups
yes that's the summary box

miral [10:53 PM]
okay
button will be alwasy there
for admin (edited)

Shikher [10:54 PM]
yes

miral [10:54 PM]
even if it is NA, admin can assign something

Shikher [10:54 PM]
and actually
we may not even need button
when they hit edit store info button
see the green button on summary section

miral [10:55 PM]
yes

Shikher [10:55 PM]
you can give option to assign/change group there
check customer details summary edit button

miral [10:56 PM]
ok ok
got that
on that modal box i can give that provision
to edit group
to admin only'

Shikher [10:56 PM]
ya go through it and we can share screen on Monday
if you need
yes

miral [10:56 PM]
ok
but now I will do rest of the thing
I will do the group work at last

Shikher [10:57 PM]
yes

miral [10:57 PM]
Now this line -
(Please add a feature Config flag that is only applicable in POpS at the store level to turn checklists on and off.  Setting this flag to ON the Opening and Closing manager checklists are not displayed/required
what this needs exactly

Shikher [11:09 PM]
let me check

miral [11:09 PM]
ok

Shikher [11:10 PM]
that should be separate task
comment that on trello
you can mention my name
it's not store info thing

miral [11:10 PM]
okay
I will do that on Monday when I will start
thank you
