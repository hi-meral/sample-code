hi

miral [9:56 PM]
I read your last comment for sync

Shikher [9:56 PM]
ok

miral [9:57 PM]
sorry for misunderstood ,
so now I have to check what changes are made in that table? (edited)
for eg, if in event table 3 rows are updated in last 10 min
i have to find what they 3 rows are
and need to fetch associated data
is that correcdt ?

Shikher [9:59 PM]
yes
associated customer ids
of parents
so event host is always parent
so sync that
if there are event customers related to that event
then get all event customer ids
if event customer id is of parent
then sync that parent's id
if event customer id is of child
then get his/her parent's id and sync parent's id

miral [10:01 PM]
in customer data we have parent and child both
so why we sync only parent customers ?

Shikher [10:02 PM]
we send emails only to parents
if you remember in cactus-services
we get child data

miral [10:02 PM]
i see
yes

Shikher [10:02 PM]
from parent's record

miral [10:02 PM]
right

Shikher [10:03 PM]
so we send children, event, inquiry data of parent
but everything goes as json for a parent
so if you sync parent id
everything related to parent will be synced

miral [10:04 PM]
okay
got it
so that function sync all realated to a parent id
right ?
removeCustomerById()
this

Shikher [10:06 PM]
syncCustomerById() can be used to sync
removeCustomerById() disables the customer record
so we need to call this only if customer record is disabled/inactive
you can check query for removeCustomer in cactus.php
I think I am only checking for enabled = 0

miral [10:08 PM]
if any customer turns to disabled, how can I know from only update_date ?

Shikher [10:09 PM]
just get enabled = 0 in last x minutes

miral [10:10 PM]
okay
so this is only in customer and event_customers table
I have to check

Shikher [10:10 PM]
no just customers

miral [10:11 PM]
ok

Shikher [10:11 PM]
if parent is disabled then call remove function
if child is disabled then call sync function for his/her parent

miral [10:12 PM]
ok got it
ok so now I am almost clear.
will start work on this on Monday
and let you know if any query
thanks
