Hi

Are you there?

miral [9:19 AM]
Yes
Just a min

bpirasanth [9:20 AM]
Ok

miral [9:23 AM]
Hi
so do I need to open the project to understand that
?

bpirasanth [9:24 AM]
Have you checked the call history page in production? It takes more than 1 min to load the page

miral [9:24 AM]
yes
i mean via browser access
i see
ok

bpirasanth [9:25 AM]
Can you make it to load that page less than 1 min? You can use prod restore db to check it on dev environment

miral [9:25 AM]
I see

bpirasanth [9:25 AM]
If it takes more than 1 min, it returns "Gateway timeout" in production

miral [9:27 AM]
but what could be the possibility as it works smoothly in staging  ?

bpirasanth [9:29 AM]
In production, events table has more nearly 1.5M records

miral [9:29 AM]
Okay than I have to look after that
and can you provide me prod restore db creds  ?

bpirasanth [9:31 AM]
DB: call-center_prod_restore
call-center / secret

miral [9:31 AM]
ok
let me try to connect that now

bpirasanth [9:31 AM]
Ok
Did you get the latest from git? Because i made some changes in code yesterday

miral [9:32 AM]
yes that I did
but I noticed in call-center project .env file
there is no call-center db is associated
only CMS db mentioned there

bpirasanth [9:35 AM]
Change the DATABASE_URL
Like this DATABASE_URL=pgsql://call-center_prod_restore:secret@54.148.66.39:5432/call-center

miral [9:37 AM]
even DATABASE_URL is not defined in my local. I am surprised how my local call-center project works !!
History page has some data too

bpirasanth [9:38 AM]
Can i remote into your machine to check?

miral [9:38 AM]
sure
one minute
ok got it
by mistake I opened old setup which is named only call-center

bpirasanth [9:41 AM]
Ok

miral [9:41 AM]
this project is call-center-twillio

bpirasanth [9:41 AM]
Yeah

miral [9:43 AM]

miral [9:44 AM]

bpirasanth [9:49 AM]
Yes, it is staging server IP

miral [9:50 AM]

446 397 117 /  8a3t3u

bpirasanth [9:59 AM]
I took nearly 1 min to load

miral [9:59 AM]
Yes
Noticed that

bpirasanth [10:00 AM]
Can you check whether you can optimize the query and make it fast
Use my credential to test
bpirasanth / P@ssw0rd$

miral [10:00 AM]
okay
u also mentioned
otherwise you need to write a cron job to populate the receiver name in the calls table then you can use that column to get receiver name
you mean only populate the receiver name and make entries to calls table ?
i mean update the calls table
?

bpirasanth [10:02 AM]
Yeah. If you're not able to make it less than a min

miral [10:02 AM]
ya okay I will try for that

bpirasanth [10:02 AM]
Ok

miral [10:03 AM]
can you tell me where I can develop a cron ?

bpirasanth [10:03 AM]
FYI. I increased the timeout from 60 sec to 120 sec to fix the timeout issue on production

miral [10:04 AM]
ok

bpirasanth [10:04 AM]
You need to create command and add schedule on Kernel.php

miral [10:06 AM]
i see
i have to check the documentation for that

bpirasanth [10:06 AM]
Ok

miral [10:06 AM]
where the command remains
in which file
?

bpirasanth [10:07 AM]
Under call-center-twilio\app\Console\Commands

miral [10:07 AM]
ok
i was checking some other Kernel.php

bpirasanth [10:08 AM]
php artisan make:console {somename}Command
Use the above command to create

miral [10:08 AM]
okay got it
I will check and fix

bpirasanth [10:08 AM]
