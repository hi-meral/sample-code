So I researched on this and found there are no Database Connection Pooling provision from php side (however in documentation  you may find PHP connection pooling but it is not database connection pooling). Of course there are few substitute available for the same and MySQL persistent connection is one of the substitutes. We can try but with 151 connection we cannot achieve the actual requirement and we need to increase that up to 1000 approx as I believe. There are few other options too with PHP but could find for Oracle, postgres etc but not specifically for MySQL. In this case I would suggest we should try with persistent connection. If you say so I will make it working in symfony.

I would like to update you regarding SMPFC. 
- A lately generated issue has not been fixed yet and continue working on this
- I asked Matthew to raise an email thread for new issue but still no update
- This issue is basically not a bug but a scalability issue of the server. On bulk requests (1000+) server stuck on responding. Mainly it is from database side. Got few ideas that will be implemented further.

Hi,
Just a thought...
the following function should not be like this 

```
public function url($path)
    {
        $bucket = getenv('AWS_BUCKET');
        return $this->s3->getObjectUrl($bucket, $this->folder . $path);
    }
```

Hello Michael,

Happy to share that it has been more than a year working with Fun Brands. I want to say Thanks to all of you for your cooperation. I am writing this to share some of my thoughts about my work. After a year, I am aware with many criteria of various projects. I learned many things from my work and with the help of Pirasanth and Shikher. Now I want to request you something for my further work. I really want to jump towards new learning and other challenging work that boost my technical knowledge. It is not like that I am not ready for less technical work like generating reports or any UI fixes but if it is possible, involve me in some more technically challenging work. Like before I worked on Web Optimization and Email Tool (Laravel digging), that was really felt me good to work. So further I am looking towards such kind of work so that I can increase my technical knowledge. This is just a request if you can manage with assigning work. Still always open for any kind of work. :)

The best way to enable this compression, is by using mod_deflate or mod_gzip. You can use them to automatically compress all HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML content. And even SVG images, which are a form of xml. If your server is not configured to compress content, and you are unable to change that, there is an alternative. It only applies to HTML, but you can add one simple line of PHP to the top of your documents, to let PHP gzip the HTML on the fly.

Simply add this line to the top of your PHP documents:
<? ob_start("ob_gzhandler"); ?>
It has to be inserted before any content is outputted. It's not as efficient as mod_deflate, but it still works well and saves a ton of bandwidth and processor power.

Hello Jaco,

I am not getting this task exactly.

Do you need any module for advertisement?
Where admin can add the images for advertisement?
What will be the preferred sized for adv. image?
Is there any description for that?
What is the scenario for displaying add in front end?

Thanks,
Miral 

But as per my opinion here a wrong thing going on for the pricing, Lets see how,

Go to the product -
http://flodev2.com/rainsoft/?page=ProductDetail&id=19

Select the following options
 - Second option Valve - 5100 cmm
- Finance price $200
- Quantity - 2

Now the final order will be generated as $400. But user is not going to pay only $400 because it is a finance price. For end of the EMI user will pay more than this !!

Does this make sense?

Bennett, there was nary a thought that they would eventually become a going concern as a band. At the time, all three members were deeply committed to burgeoning solo careers that they had no intentions of putting on hold. Twelve years later, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings has organically evolved into one of the finest roots-oriented bands in North America, having released six CDs and evolved a feeling of brotherhood manifested in a sense of groove, timbral blend and melodic and rhythmic play that is distinctive, mystical, energizing and constantly evocative. The sum is indeed greater than the parts - and the parts are as good as they get.

Derek,

Okey, I got , The ‘user menu’ provides access to all files necessary.

Yes this can be done. But for now the way User Menu was developed, is static code. It is not including all files necessary. I have to develop so that it will includes all the file.

Thanks,
Miral

h.      Add the “Send to Phone” icon and hyperlink on this page http://www.menupix.com/champaign/restaurants/423780/Cafe-Luna-Champaign-IL to the right of the restaurant’s phone number 

m.    The default smiley face icon for the “Best in City” button should be red.  If the person clicks on it to indicate it is a best in the city, the icon should turn to Green

n.      The default star icon for the “Favorite” button should be red.  If the person clicks on it to indicate it is a favorite for them the page should refresh and the icon turns Green and the restaurant is added to their favorites

1, 2(a), 4(i)- partially,4(ii),4(x)

i. In the header of the page in the US there is a link for “Advanced Search”.  In Canada there is no link.  There should be a link in Canada in the header for an advanced seatch.

ii. On the top of the page in the US it says “Search MenuPix.com” and in Canada it says “Search British Columbia” which is dynamic.  The text in the US should be like Canada’s page and be dynamic and not bold.  This should be done on all pages in the US that have the search bar.

x. On the left side under the listing of cuisines in Canada there is a slot for a 160 ad.  In the US there is no ad slot for the 160 ad.  There should be a 160 ad slot on the left on both pages.
